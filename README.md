# Connect4-ML

**--ARCHIVED--**
 A game Connect4 to be played against various ML methods, starting with minimax, experimentation with Q-Learning and Neural Networks was also completed.

## Development / Testing

The game was written in HTML so that it can be opened in Google Chrome and run. If you wish to continue development, simple clone or download the repository and open "main.html" in Google Chrome (Other web browsers may work but aren't necessarily supported).

Future work: 
- Improve Minimax to take advantage of suboptimal opponents by breaking ties by re-evaluating based on less than optimal opponent moves,

- Optimize the minimax solution to utilize a depth deeper than 8.
- Continue development of Q-Learning and Neural Network Solutions
